Formatting and style standards for this C# project:

- 4-space indentation.
- Always use a blank line between code blocks (methods, properties, constructors, etc).
- Always add a blank line before if, for, foreach, and return.
- Do not use a blank line after opening or before closing braces.
- Use expression-bodied members on a new line.
- Constant names in UPPER_CASE.
- Use var when the type is obvious.
- XMLDoc is mandatory for public classes and methods.
- Non-inheritable classes must be sealed.
- DRY: avoid code repetition.
- Use modern collections and initializers ([] and [..] when possible).
- <inherited /> for inherited members in XMLDoc.
